# Junction-2021-Team-Kentang
This is our repository for Junction 2021 submission

## Description
The repository contains all the files used in the creation of this project, starting from the parsed version of the JSON database up to the application used as a prototype. The folders of the repository are layouted as follows : 
- db.json
- Forecast_code_and_result
- data
- app
- app_new
- app_new_new
- parse.py
- requirements.txt


### Data Parsing
db.json as the main database file is first parsed with parse.py, creating the folder data with easy-to-read versions of the data. The folders inside data are named with the following format : `apartment-index_number-of-people`. Each folder inside data contain 5 files each detailing different products used. 

### App Files
There are three tries corresponding to the mobile application made with flutter in the repository. `app` contains the foremost and simplest rendition of the app. `app_new` contains the second rendition of the application while `app_new_new` is the third and final rendition of the application. To run the application, make sure flutter 2.5.3 is installed in your computer and type `flutter run` inside any of the file folder. 

### Data Processing Results
All data processing resutls are kept inside the folder `Forecast_code_and_result` and `Data.ipynb`. The former keeps the codes and datas required to run the machine learning algorithm to forecast.    
`Data.ipynb` conatins resources required to process the data
